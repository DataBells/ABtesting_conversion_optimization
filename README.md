# Business Questions

Throughout the analysis, we addressed **23 key business questions** that helped us uncover actionable insights for optimizing the landing pages and user experience. These questions were centered around understanding:

1. **User Engagement**: How are users interacting with the website?
2. **Conversion Metrics**: Which landing page variant and user behaviors are driving conversions?
3. **Demographics Impact**: How do age, gender, location, and device type influence conversion rates?
4. **Marketing Strategy**: Which traffic sources (organic, paid, referral) perform best?
5. **Revenue Analysis**: How does session behavior impact revenue generation and average order value?
6. **User Segmentation**: What are the behaviors of first-time visitors vs. returning users?
7. **Time & Session Metrics**: What is the impact of time spent and pages visited on conversions?

# How We Analyzed the Questions

Each of these business questions was analyzed using various statistical methods and techniques:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand the distribution of data, conversion rates, and behavior across different segments (age, gender, device type).
- **A/B Testing**: To compare landing page variants and determine the most effective one in terms of conversion rates.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Employed tests like two-proportion z-tests, T-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to assess statistical significance.
- **Regression Analysis**: Used logistic regression to analyze the relationship between user behaviors (time spent, pages visited) and conversion rates.
- **Multivariate Testing**: To account for multiple factors affecting conversions, including demographic and engagement variables.
- **Bayesian Methods & Multi-Armed Bandits**: To dynamically evaluate which landing page variant performs best over time.
- **Sequential Testing**: Analyzed conversion rates as sample sizes increased to ensure stable and reliable results.
